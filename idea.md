# Investment Memo: Untitled

## Introduction

1. What is the problem you are solving?

Untitled is addressing the growing cybersecurity challenges in an AI-driven future where:

- Software engineering is becoming commoditized, leading to exponentially more code being generated with less human oversight
- Traditional human-based entry points for cyberattacks (e.g. social engineering) are diminishing as lower-level roles become automated
- The technical layer of cybersecurity is becoming paramount, superseding human factors
- AI is empowering hackers to discover vulnerabilities and create exploit chains at unprecedented scales

These challenges are reflected in the rapidly growing cybersecurity market. The global cybersecurity market size was valued at USD 202.72 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow from USD 223.81 billion in 2023 to USD 424.97 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 9.6% during the forecast period [Fortune Business Insights].

2. How did you find out that the problem exists?

Discovered this problem while exploring cryptocurrency and cybersecurity after finishing work on a previous consumer AI startup (text-to-video for students). With a background in hacking and full-stack engineering, he noticed the use of formal verification in high-stakes crypto protocols and military/aerospace applications.

Background includes:
- Hacking/security experience (CTFs, industry, misc)
- Full-stack engineering, mobile engineering, and microservices development
- Experience with machine learning pipelines
- Work at various startups, from pre-seed to Series C/D stage
- Built and scaled products to 20k+ MAUs multiple times
- Built and scaled cashflow business (devshop) to $120k ARR

3. How does the world work now in relation to this problem?

Currently, cybersecurity relies heavily on:

- Siloed intrusion detection/prevention systems
- Alerts from various security vendors (e.g. SIEM, SOAR, application security tools)
- Human analysts (SOC and blue team) to aggregate context and identify real threats among false positives
- A focus on human-based entry points (e.g. phishing customer support) as the primary attack vector

Note that most current breaches are not due to zero-day vulnerabilities, but rather through social engineering of human employees, particularly in customer-facing roles like customer support.

4. How do you solve the problem?

Untitled proposes to build a comprehensive AI-powered context layer for cybersecurity organizations that:

- Utilizes formalization and formal verification as its foundation
- Aggregates context across all layers of an organization (application, network, etc.)
- Employs AI to intelligently detect and respond to threats in real-time
- Potentially replaces much of the current blue team functions
- Provides robust testing capabilities against potential attacks

The solution involves:
- Solving the challenge of formalization for AI, which is necessary for formal verification
- Creating a unified context layer that breaks down silos between different security tools and systems
- Automating threat detection and response across all technical layers
- Offering advanced code testing and vulnerability assessment capabilities

5. What is the scale of the opportunity?

The cybersecurity market is massive and growing rapidly. The global cost of cybercrime is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015 [Cybersecurity Ventures], driving increased investment in security solutions. 

Untitled's focus on formal verification taps into a niche but fast-growing market, projected to reach USD 1,114.7 million by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 16.3% [Allied Market Research]. 

Formal verification audits for top crypto protocols can cost between $3-5 million each, indicating significant revenue potential in this initial market.

As AI transforms the threat landscape, there will be an increasing need for advanced, AI-driven defensive systems. The potential to replace or augment significant portions of current cybersecurity operations represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity.
